## Overview
 This is a front-end web development project 1 for Treehouse. I practiced my web design skills by editing HTML elements and styles in CSS. With the HTML and CSS already provided, I was asked to add, edit, and remove the pre-existing code and make it my own. Part of the project was to also add additional pages and images on your own for meeting the exceeds criteria.  This project was very helpful for me to understand HTML.
